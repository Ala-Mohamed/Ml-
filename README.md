This course will serve as an introduction to machine learning concepts and their application in biological data. It covers key concepts of machine learning, including feature pre-processing, feature construction, dimensionality reduction, classification models, model selection and evaluation
Course Learning Objectives:
1. Recognize the different fields of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised
learning, and identifying scenarios where it makes sense to apply machine learning for real-
world problem-solving. (LEC)
2. Compute data as features required for machine learning models. (LEC+HW)
3. Identify different classification techniques. (LEC+HW)
4. Assess the machine learning model quality. (LEC+HW)
5. Use the Python programming language and packages for implementing machine learning
algorithms. (LEC + HW)
6. Collect a repertoire of different algorithms and approaches to machine learning (data and
algorithmic models / parametric and nonparametric models) and understanding their various
strengths and weaknesses. (LEC)
7. Design an approach to leverage data using the steps in the machine learning process.
(LEC+HW)
